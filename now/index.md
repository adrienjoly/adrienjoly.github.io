## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 💼  &nbsp; Since April 2025, I've enjoyed working and jamming with my colleagues at [Didask](https://www.didask.com/), a start-up that develops a Learning Management System that applies recommendations from Cognitive Sciences research.

- 🎙️  &nbsp; Jérémie Girault and I have co-hosted [le SAV de la Tech](https://www.lesav.tech/), a podcast in which we answer listeners' questions related to soft-skills and career development in the tech workspace.

    - A problematic situation or question you would like to be addressed in an episode? Share it with us: http://lesav.tech/question (in 🇫🇷 French)

- 🎸  &nbsp; News and upcoming concerts with my 3 bands: [Harissa](https://harissaofficial.com), [Boro](https://linktr.ee/borotheband) and [Rag Dolls](https://linktr.ee/ragdolls).

- 👾  &nbsp; To relax, I enjoy [playing video games](https://ggapp.io/omikron) and [VR experiences](/vr). These days, I mostly play Dirt Rally 2 and American Truck Simulator with my wheel, pedals and gear shifter.
