## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼  &nbsp; As a Tech Coach, Iâ€™m helping Omieâ€™s technical team improve the quality of their software products and development processes.

- ðŸŽ¸  &nbsp; Until we find concert opportunities with Â«Â [Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)Â Â» and Â«Â The Rag DollsÂ Â», Iâ€™m learning to play the guitar.

- ðŸŒ¶  &nbsp; Iâ€™m exciting about the upcoming concerts weâ€™re giving with "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)" and "The Rag Dolls", the rock cover band I've recently joined!
