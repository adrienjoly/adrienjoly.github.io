## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 💼  &nbsp; For the past 1.5 years, I've been working as a Software Engineer at [Heal.dev](https://www.heal.dev/), a service to help development teams monitor their web application for regressions and bugs.

- 🎙️  &nbsp; Jérémie Girault and I enjoy publishing new episodes of [le SAV de la Tech](https://www.lesav.tech/), a podcast in which we answer listeners' questions related to soft-skills and career development in the tech workspace.

    - A problematic situation or question you would like to be addressed in an episode? Share it with us: http://lesav.tech/question (in 🇫🇷 French)
