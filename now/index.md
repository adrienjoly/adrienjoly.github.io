## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 💼  &nbsp; In March 2025, I left [Heal.dev](https://www.heal.dev/) to join [Didask](https://www.didask.com/), a start-up that develops a Learning Management System that applies recommendations from Cognitive Sciences research.

- 🎙️  &nbsp; Jérémie Girault and I enjoy publishing new episodes of [le SAV de la Tech](https://www.lesav.tech/), a podcast in which we answer listeners' questions related to soft-skills and career development in the tech workspace.
