## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 💼  &nbsp; In March 2025, I left [Heal.dev](https://www.heal.dev/) to join [Didask](https://www.didask.com/), a start-up that develops a Learning Management System that applies recommendations from Cognitive Sciences research.

- 🎙️  &nbsp; Jérémie Girault and I enjoy publishing new episodes of [le SAV de la Tech](https://www.lesav.tech/), a podcast in which we answer listeners' questions related to soft-skills and career development in the tech workspace.

    - A problematic situation or question you would like to be addressed in an episode? Share it with us: http://lesav.tech/question (in 🇫🇷 French)

- 🎸  &nbsp; I'm currently composing new music with Boro, in a beach house at La Seyne-sur-Mer. News and upcoming concerts with [Harissa](https://harissaofficial.com), [Boro](https://linktr.ee/borotheband) and [Rag Dolls](https://linktr.ee/ragdolls):

    - check out Harissa's latest album:  [To Frenesium and Beyond](https://music.imusician.pro/artist/00oYkcbvCn/releases).

- 👾  &nbsp; To relax, I enjoy [playing video games](https://ggapp.io/omikron) and [VR experiences](/vr). These days, I mostly play Colin McRae Rallye 2 (PS1) and Cosmic Collapse (Pico-8) on my handheld retrogaming console
