## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 🎙️  &nbsp; Jérémie Girault and I enjoy publishing new episodes of [le SAV de la Tech](https://www.lesav.tech/), a podcast in which we answer listeners' questions related to soft-skills and career development in the tech workspace.

- 🎸  &nbsp; Upcoming concerts with [Harissa](https://harissaofficial.com), [Boro](https://linktr.ee/borotheband) and Rag Dolls:

    - [26/07/2024] "Gimme Shelter" (rock classics) @ Supersonic, Paris

- 👾  &nbsp; To relax, I enjoy [playing video games](https://ggapp.io/omikron). In [VR](/vr), mostly Pistol Whip. On my couch, I’m currently enjoying Outer Wilds and XCOM Enemy Unknown.
