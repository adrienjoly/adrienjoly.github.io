## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼  &nbsp; I've been working with the technical team of [Choose](https://appchoose.io/) since April 2021, to help them scale their back-end software and development processes.

- ðŸŽ“  &nbsp; I had a lot of fun co-presenting a 3-hour talk at Devoxx France with Julien TopÃ§u and Jordan Nourry (see [/talks](/talks)) and I'm quite proud of the result: [Â«Â Architecturoplastie hexagonale dâ€™un backend Node.js: OpÃ©ration Ã  code ouvertÂ Â»](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2XMwAUqZBA).

- ðŸŒ¶  &nbsp; Iâ€™m exciting about the upcoming concerts weâ€™re giving with "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)" and "The Rag Dolls", the rock cover band I've recently joined!

  > Harissaâ€˜s album, "[Radio DÃ©sert](https://harissa.bandcamp.com/album/radio-d-sert)", is available on most music platforms.

- ðŸ‘¾  &nbsp; To relax, I enjoy [playing video games](https://ggapp.io/omikron). In [VR](/vr), mostly Swarm and Pistol Whip. On my couch, Iâ€™m currently enjoying GTA 5.
