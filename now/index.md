## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 💼  &nbsp; I recently left SHODO to join a new startup company. I'll provide more details soon!

- 🎙️  &nbsp; Jérémie Girault and I are starting a podcast in which we answer to listeners' questions related to soft-skills and career development in the tech workspace: [le SAV de la Tech](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/sav-de-la-tech).

- 🎓  &nbsp; I'll give a fun talk at BDX/IO in November: "[Composer de la musique 8-bit en JavaScript, avec WebAudio](https://bdxio.fr/talks/606)".

  > Check out my list of [talks](/talks) and [posts](/posts).
  
- 🎸  &nbsp; We're composing [Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)'s second album, open for concert opportunities with [The Rag Dolls](https://linktr.ee/ragdolls), and I’m learning to play the guitar.

  > Harissa‘s album, "[Radio Désert](https://ampl.ink/harissa-radio-desert)", is available on most music platforms.

- 👾  &nbsp; To relax, I enjoy [playing video games](https://ggapp.io/omikron). In [VR](/vr), mostly FitXR, Kayak VR and Pistol Whip. On my couch, I’m currently enjoying Fort Triumph.
