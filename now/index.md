## What I’m doing these days

I’m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- 💼  &nbsp; I recently left SHODO to join a new startup company. I'll provide more details soon!

- 🎙️  &nbsp; Jérémie Girault and I enjoy publishing new episodes of [le SAV de la Tech](https://www.lesav.tech/), a podcast in which we answer listeners' questions related to soft-skills and career development in the tech workspace.

- 🎸  &nbsp; While we're composing [Harissa](https://www.instagram.com/harissaquartet)'s second album, I’m learning to play the guitar and I enjoy giving concerts with other projects, including [Boro](https://www.instagram.com/borotheband).

- 👾  &nbsp; To relax, I enjoy [playing video games](https://ggapp.io/omikron). In [VR](/vr), mostly Zombieland, Kayak VR and Pistol Whip. On my couch, I’m currently enjoying The Last Of Us.
