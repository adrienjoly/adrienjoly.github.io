## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼  &nbsp; I've been working with the technical team of [Choose](https://appchoose.io/) since April 2021, to help them industrialize some parts of their back-end software.

- ðŸŽ“  &nbsp; Now that I'm freed from my [teaching](/teaching) engagements, I gave 2 live coding streams on Twitch with Julien TopÃ§u (see [/talks](/talks)) and I'm preparing a talk about clean code for DevFest Nantes 2021.

- ðŸŒ¶  &nbsp; I can't wait to be able to give concerts again, with my band "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)" and/or with a new rock cover band I've recently joined!

  > Our album, "[Radio DÃ©sert](https://harissa.bandcamp.com/album/radio-d-sert)", is available on most music platforms.

- ðŸ›°  &nbsp; To relax, I still enjoy playing (almost) everyday on my [Oculus Quest](/vr), mostly exploring planets in [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/).
