## What Iâ€™m doing these days

Iâ€™m home in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

- ðŸ’¼  &nbsp; I've been working with the technical team of [Choose](https://appchoose.io/) since April 2021, to help them scale their back-end software and development processes.

- ðŸŽ“  &nbsp; I enjoyed giving a 45-mn live-coding session at DevFest Nantes 2021 (see [/talks](/talks)) and I'm planning to give shorter versions at other events soon.

- ðŸŒ¶  &nbsp; I recently gave concerts with "[Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet)" and "The Rag Dolls", a new pop/rock cover band I've recently joined!

  > Our album, "[Radio DÃ©sert](https://harissa.bandcamp.com/album/radio-d-sert)", is available on most music platforms.

- ðŸ›°  &nbsp; To relax, I enjoy playing on my [Oculus Quest](/vr), mostly exploring planets in [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/).
