Hi!

My name is Adrien Joly (he/him). I live in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

As a **Tech Lead** and **Coach**, I help development teams maintain and scale complex software. I love renovating legacy codebases, to reduce technical debt, increase robustness and development velocity. (see [my services](/pro) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ / ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [prestations](/pro/fr))

I enjoy **sharing what I've learned**, by:

- [teaching](/teaching),
- giving [talks](/talks),
- writing [articles](/posts)
- and maintaining [open-source projects](/prod).

As a **musician**, I have been **playing drums** for [various bands and other musical projects](/music). I participated to the composition and recording of two albums: [Radio DÃ©sert](https://ampl.ink/harissa-radio-desert) (with my band [Harissa](https://www.facebook.com/harissaquartet/)) and [Survived The Great Flood](https://www.discogs.com/fr/Man-Is-Not-A-Bird-Survived-The-Great-Flood/master/870529). (with my previous band: Man Is Not A Bird)
