Hi!

My name is Adrien Joly (he/him). I live in Montreuil, Paris area, France.

As a passionate **software engineer** who loves prototyping, developing, maintaining and scaling complex software, I enjoy sharing what I've learned, by:

- hosting a podcast: [le SAV de la Tech](https://www.lesav.tech/),
- writing [articles](/posts)
- giving [talks](/talks),
- [teaching](/teaching),
- and maintaining [open-source projects](/prod).

As a **musician**, I have been **playing drums** for [various bands and other musical projects](/music). I participated to the composition and recording of three albums, including: [Radio DÃ©sert](https://ampl.ink/harissa-radio-desert) (with my band [Harissa](https://harissaofficial.com/)) and [Survived The Great Flood](https://www.discogs.com/fr/Man-Is-Not-A-Bird-Survived-The-Great-Flood/master/870529). (with my previous band: Man Is Not A Bird)
