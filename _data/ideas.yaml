    We, internet-connected citizens, use digital tools and consume digital media increasingly. This gives us access to an unprecedented amount of knowledge. The problem has shifted from "how to do X" to "what's the best resource to help me do X". In that context, my opinion is that: 1/ we need to improve the way we express our intents and preferences, and the way we discover, keep and find knowledge that is relevant to each of us, whatever the context; and 2/ data tracking done by Google and many other providers could actually help us achieve that, as long as we're able to access it. (See [How to Track Your YouTube Watching (And Understand It) - Mark Koester](http://www.markwk.com/youtube-tracking.html) and [How to Track the Articles You Read and Augment Your Digital Memory - Mark Koester](http://www.markwk.com/2016/11/tracking-article-reading.html))
